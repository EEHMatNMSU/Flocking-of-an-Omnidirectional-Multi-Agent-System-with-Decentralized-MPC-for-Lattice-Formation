# Flocking of an Omnidirectional Multi-Agent System with Decentralized MPC for Lattice Formation
# Flocking of an Omnidirectional Multi-Agent System with Decentralized MPC for Lattice Formation: Sigma-Norm Design and Comparative Performance Assessment  ## General  This repository contains the simulation code to reproduce the tables and figures presented in  Eusebio E. Hern√°ndez, Hengameh Mirhajianmoghadam, Eduardo S. Espinoza, Luis Rodolfo Garcia Carrillo, "Flocking of an Omnidirectional Multi-Agent System with Decentralized MPC for Lattice Formation: Sigma-Norm Design and Comparative Performance Assessment", 2025  The code has one main entry point, the script `nexecutions.m`, that is in the root directory of this repository.  It will produce among others the material presented in the article.  The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment: * *Windows 11pro* Version 24H2 * *Matlab* 2024b
